This is the first task

The Author give us a `story.txt`, `Flag.png` and a zip file and ask us to detect the city name , after reading the story 
```
Hi, my name is James Harper,I'm based in a city in the US
```
The city is one of the US cities. 

Now we should try to search the city name using my `Flag.png`
