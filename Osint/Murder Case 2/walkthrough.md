Hi, my name is James Harper,I'm based in a city in the US, but at work, they call me "Glitch." I'm still youngâ€”I was born in 1999. I work for the FBI, but I have a bad memory, so most of my account passwords are just my birthday. November 20, 2024, was the worst day of my life. It was the day my little girl died. I can still remember the days leading up to it so vividly. Just four days before, we were celebrating my birthday together. She was so full of life, her laughter filled the room, and her smile was like sunshine. She was my angel, my everything.
